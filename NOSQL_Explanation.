No matter the original public database or the data warehouse are different from the No SQL database. The No SQL database is non-relational. It does not contain many relational tables which linked each other with keys. Take MongoDB as example, as MongoDB is a document-oriented database program, the files will be stored individually with JSON-like documents rather than tables and rows. It is more likely to be considered a tree format which implemented with subclass key-value pairs. Coming back to the relational disease data warehouse, the main fact table of dimensional schema might possibly apply No SQL with the same structure. The main fact table contains many dimensions and values. The dimensions and measures information can be written as key-value pairs. Therefore, each fact can be taken as an individual document which contains all information needed. In our opinion, the facts can be either filed as No SQL files or relational schemas. The difference will occur if a patient had more than 1(one) visit. No SQL structure will put all the visits under the patientâ€™s file, while relational will keep the relations with keys pointing to the right place. It depends on how you want to use it.
